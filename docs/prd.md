  - Return created agent details with unique identifier

#### Retrieve Agent (Required)

- Endpoint: GET /agents/{agent_id}
- Functionality:
  - Fetch agent details by ID
  - Return complete agent information including name, files, websites, and messages

#### Delete Agent (Required)

- Endpoint: DELETE /agents/{agent_id}
- Functionality:
  - Remove agent and associated data from the system
  - Return 204 status on successful deletion

### 2.2 Research Capabilities

#### Query Processing (Required)

- Endpoint: POST /agents/{agent_id}/queries
- Functionality:
  - Accept user research queries
  - Process queries through GPT-4o-mini LLM
  - Determine appropriate tools for research
  - Execute tool-specific queries
  - Synthesize information from multiple sources
  - Return comprehensive research results

#### Research Tools Integration

Must integrate with at least one of:

- PubMed for medical and scientific research
